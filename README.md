# Python-Exercises
A variety of exercises I attempt as I learn how to make small and simple Python projects. All of the websites I post on here are free and beginner friendly. I will give credit to all exercise authors if explicitly stated within exercise.

The purpose of this repo is to track my growth as I become acustomed to programming and eventually move to other languages.
