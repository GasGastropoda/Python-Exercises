# EXERCISE 02 - Odd Or Even | https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html
# Write a program which asks the user for a number. Then print a response
# depending on whether that number is odd or even.
# Odd numbers divided by 2 will have a remainder, even numbers will not.

#Get number from user
#Convert string value into integer to divide
# Assign value to variable in order to divide 
number_value = int(input("Input a number here: "))

# assign a variable to the modulo
deciding_operation = number_value % 2
ex_deciding_operation = number_value % 4

# Assign conditions
if deciding_operation != 0:
    print("Your number is odd!")
elif ex_deciding_operation == 0:
    print("This number is a multiple of four!")
else:
    print("Your number is even!")
